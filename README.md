# SFU-Course-Planner

The students of SFU face some problems during the time of enrollment for the next semesters and they want to know the complete information about the course. Students want to know about the previous terms in which this course was offered and which professors offered the course and how many students enrolled in the course and in which year and semester. In order to create this help for the students, there was a need of one stop webApp for SFU students and hence this app was designed so that students can get all the information about the courses during the time of their enrollment.
